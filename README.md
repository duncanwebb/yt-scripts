# yt-scripts
A set of avisynth scripts that I use for my youtube videos.

The python script _buildavs.py_ generates an avs file for to process the audio. MEGui available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/megui/ is a really great wrapper around avisynth.

## Music
In the scripts are some creative commans copyrighted files which are available on-line at.
Intro: Creepy Background Sound by Daniel Simion is available at http://soundbible.com/2165-Creepy-Background.html
Outro: Owl's Secret from The Owl by Daria Shakhova is available at http://freemusicarchive.org/music/The_Owl/Fairy_Forest/the_owl_-_owls_secret
